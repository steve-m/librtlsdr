.TH "rtl_sdr" 1 "0.5.0" RTL-SDR "User Commands"
.SH NAME
rtl-sdr \- an I/Q recorder for RTL2832 based DVB-T receivers
.SH DESCRIPTION
Uses a re-purposed DVB-T receiver as a software defined
radio to receive signals in I/Q data form. Written for
and incorporated in the osmocom rtl-sdr project.
.LP
In-Phase and Quadrature Phase data can faithfully represent
all of the information in a band of frequencies centered
on a carrier signal frequency.
.LP
Much software is available for the RTL2832. Most of the user-level
packages rely on the librtlsdr library which comes as part of the
rtl-sdr codebase. This codebase contains both the library itself and
also a number of command line tools such as rtl_test, rtl_sdr,
rtl_tcp, and rtl_fm. These command line tools use the library to test
for the existence of RTL2832 devices and to perform basic data
transfer functions to and from the device.
.LP
Because most of the RTL2832 devices are connected using USB, the
librtlsdr library depends on the libusb library to communicate with
the device.
.SH USAGE
This program captures information from a band of frequencies
and outputs the data in a form useful to other software radio
programs.

.SH EXAMPLES
.IP "Example: To tune to 392.0 MHz, and set the sample-rate to 1.8 MS/s, use:"
 ./rtl_sdr /tmp/capture.bin -s 1.8e6 -f 392e6
.LP
to record samples to a file or to forward the data to a fifo.
.LP
If the device can't be opened, make sure you have the appropriate
rights to access the device (install udev-rules from the repository,
or run it as root).
